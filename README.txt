This is simply a repository where I'll be uploading challenges and python code

Array Challenge
Have the function ArrayChallenge(arr) take the array of numbers stored in arr which will contain integers that represent the amount in dollars that a single stock is worth, and return the maximum profit that could have been made by buying stock on day x and selling stock on day y where y > x. For example: if arr is [44, 30, 24, 32, 35, 30, 40, 38, 15] then your program should return 16 because at index 2 the stock was worth $24 and at index 6 the stock was then worth $40, so if you bought the stock at 24 and sold it at 40, you would have made a profit of $16, which is the maximum profit that could have been made with this list of stock prices.

If there is not profit that could have been made with the stock prices, then your program should return -1. For example: arr is [10, 9, 8, 2] then your program should return -1.

Codeland Username Validation

Have the function CodelandUsernameValidation(str) take the str parameter being passed and determine if the string is a valid username according to the following rules:

1. The username is between 4 and 25 characters.
2. It must start with a letter.
3. It can only contain letters, numbers, and the underscore character.
4. It cannot end with an underscore character.

If the username is valid then your program should return the string true, otherwise return the string false.
